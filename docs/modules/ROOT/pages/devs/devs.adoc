== Contributions / License

Before starting development, please read our
xref:devs/contributions.adoc[contribution requirements].

== Getting the Source Code

The easiest way to get the source code is checking it out from our
{GITHUB}[Git repository]:

 git clone https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan.git

== Browsing the Source Code

The Git repository can be browsed directly at {GITHUB}[GitHub].

== Source Code Documentation

strongSwan uses extractable inline documentation extensively. This documentation
is extracted with {DOXYGEN}[Doxygen] for the latest release and uploaded to
{APIDOC}[strongswan.org/apidoc]. Use `*make apidoc*` to generate it from the
sources.

== Code style

For our code we heavily use an
xref:devs/objectOrientedC.adoc[object oriented programming style] for C. Also
have a look to our basic xref:devs/programmingStyle.adoc[programming style]
guidelines.

== Quality Assurance

=== Unit Tests

Our libraries are tested with an increasing number of unit tests. To run them use
`*make check*`. The following environment variables change the behavior of the
test runner:

[cols="2,5,1"]
|===
|Variable |Description |Since Version

|`TESTS_PLUGINS`
|A space-separated list of plugins to load +
 (not implemented by all test runners)
|5.3.3

|`TESTS_REDUCED_KEYLENGTHS`
|If this is set, test cases that generate keys will do so only for reduced key
 lengths to avoid blocking on hosts with low entropy
|

|`TESTS_STRONGSWAN_CONF`
|Path to a custom xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] file used
 for the tests
|5.2.0

|`TESTS_RUNNERS`
|A comma-separated list of test runners to run
|5.5.0

|`TESTS_SUITES`
|A comma-separated list of test suites to run +
 (all suites are run if this is not specified)
|

|`TESTS_SUITES_EXCLUDE`
|A comma-separated list of test suites excluded from running
|5.2.1

|`TESTS_CASES`
|A comma-separated list of test cases to run +
 (all cases of selected suites are run if this is not specified)
|5.9.0

|`TESTS_CASES_EXCLUDE`
|A comma-separated list of test cases excluded from running
|5.9.0

|`TESTS_FUNCTIONS`
|A comma-separated list of test functions to run
 (all functions of selected suites/cases are run if this is not specified)
|5.9.0

|`TESTS_FUNCTIONS_EXCLUDE`
|A comma-separated list of test functions excluded from running
|5.9.0

|`TESTS_ITERATIONS`
|A comma-separated list of iterations of a loop-based test function to run
 (all iterations are run if this is not specified)
|5.9.8

|`TESTS_NO_IPV6`
|Disables IPv6 test cases (e.g. to run the tests in Docker containers that only
 provide IPv4 networking)
|5.9.6

|`TESTS_VERBOSITY`
|The log level used when running the tests (`*-1*` to `*4*` with a default of
 `*-1*`), see xref:config/logging.adoc[Logging]
|

|`TESTS_VERBOSITY_<GROUP>`
|The log level used for a specific log group (`*CFG*`, `*IKE*`, etc.) when
 running the tests (`*-1*` to `*4*` with a default of `*TESTS_VERBOSITY*`),
 see xref:config/logging.adoc[Logging]
|5.9.7

|`LEAK_DETECTIVE_DISABLE`
|If our custom memory allocator is enabled with `*--enable-leak-detective*`, it
 can be disabled temporarily by setting this variable in order to speed up
 running the tests
|
|===

Coverage reports can be generated with `*make coverage*` which requires the
`*--enable-coverage*` xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option which
is not recommended for production builds as it disables all optimizations.

The unit tests also run automatically for every commit:

=== Testing Environment

Our integration and regression
xref:devs/testingEnvironment.adoc[testing environment] helps us ensure the quality
of future releases. The test results for the latest strongSwan release are
published {TESTS}[online].
