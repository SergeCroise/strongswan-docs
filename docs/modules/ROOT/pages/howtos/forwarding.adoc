== Overview

In remote access situations clients will usually send all their traffic to the
gateway. Below we explain how this traffic can be forwarded and properly routed
back to the roadwarriors.

In some situations, it might be more desirable to send only specific traffic via
the gateway, for instance, to unburden it from forwarding web or even worse, file
sharing traffic. Therefore, we also explain how to enable so-called _split-tunneling_
for different clients.

== Forwarding Client Traffic

In order to forward traffic to hosts behind the gateway (or hosts on the Internet
if split-tunneling is not used), the following option has to be enabled on Linux
gateways
----
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
----
This can be added to `*/etc/sysctl.conf*` to enable it permanently.

If the firewall on the gateway is rather restrictive, then

 connections.<conn>.children.<child>.updown = /usr/libexec/ipsec/_updown iptables

will automatically cause the default xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*_updown*`] script
to add rules that allow traffic to be forwarded.

In remote access setups, VPN clients will be assigned a
xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] address from a configured address pool. The
important thing on the gateway side is that all hosts to which the gateway forwards
traffic to, have to know that they must route packets to be tunneled back to the
remote access clients via the VPN gateway.

Please note that there might be additional considerations when hosting on
xref:howtos/cloudPlatforms.adoc[cloud platforms] (e.g. src/dst address checks).

=== Hosts on the LAN

For hosts on the LAN behind the gateway the following situations are possible:

The virtual IPs are from the subnet behind the gateway ::
  In this situation either the xref:plugins/dhcp.adoc[`*dhcp*`] plugin is used or
  the gateway assigns xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses from a subnet
  of the whole LAN behind the gateway (distinct from the IP addresses assigned via
  DHCP to other LAN hosts). If that is the case, the xref:plugins/farp.adoc[`*farp*`]
  plugin must be used so that the hosts behind the gateway may learn that they have
  to send response packets to the VPN gateway. For IPv6 something similar can be
  done using Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP) proxying.

The virtual IPs are from a distinct subnet / In site-to-site scenarios ::
  If the VPN gateway is the *default gateway* of the accessed LAN nothing special
  has to be done.  If this is not the case, either add a route on all hosts behind
  the gateway (manually or e.g. via {RFC3442}[DHCP option 121]), telling them that
  the subnet from which virtual IP addresses are assigned to roadwarriors or remote
  subnets in *site-to-site* scenarios can be reached through the VPN gateway.
+
Alternatively configure a static route on the actual default gateway that redirects
traffic for the virtual subnet to the VPN gateway. It's also possible to NAT the
virtual IPs to the (internal) IP address of the gateway, so that requests from
remote clients will look to LAN hosts as if they originated from the gateway (see
the next section for notes on setting up a NAT).

If the VPN gateway is not the default gateway of the LAN, ICMP redirects might get
returned to hosts if they send traffic destined for the remote hosts/subnets to the
VPN gateway, directing them to the default gateway of the LAN (which probably doesn't
work and otherwise might get that traffic out unencrypted). To avoid this, disable
sending such ICMP messages by setting
----
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
----
If the latter option is not set before the network interface comes up, also set
the option for the individual interface
----
net.ipv4.conf.<iface>.send_redirects=0
----

=== Hosts on the Internet

If *split-tunneling* is not used, all client traffic will be sent through the IPsec
tunnel. In this scenario '*local_ts = 0.0.0.0/0*` is configured on the gateway and
`*remote_ts = 0.0.0.0/0*` on the client.  Now, the gateway could simply ignore
or drop traffic not destined for subnets it doesn't want the clients to access.
But that is probably not what most users expect.  It is more likely that they
expect being able to continue to surf the web or read their emails while being
connected to the VPN.

The situation here is similar to the one for LAN hosts above. If the gateway would
simply forward traffic from the virtual subnet to hosts on the Internet, these hosts
wouldn't be able respond because they would send their response to the virtual IP
address. What is therefore required are *NAT rules* so that hosts in the virtual
subnet are mapped to at least one IP address of the VPN gateway (which itself could
be behind a NAT device too). For hosts on the Internet, traffic from the virtual
subnet then would appear to originate from the VPN gateway.

By way of example, let's assume the gateway assigns virtual IPs from the
`*10.0.3.0/24*` subnet to its roadwarrior clients. The following `*iptables*` rules
will NAT traffic from that subnet to the gateway's `*eth0*` interface (this works
even for gateways that have only one network interface).
----
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.3.0/24 -o eth0 -m policy --dir out --pol ipsec -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.3.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
----

The first rule exempts traffic that matches an IPsec policy from the NAT rule.
Additional subnets behind the gateway may be listed after `*-s*`, like
`*-s 10.0.3.0/24,192.168.88.0/24*`. The `*-s*` option may also be omitted altogether
to match all outbound traffic.

== General NAT problems

Local firewall stacks generally don't treat packets with a matching IPsec policy
any different from unprotected packets. That means NAT rules also apply to traffic
that is supposed to be tunneled.

This often leads to problems, because many hosts have `SNAT` or `MASQUERADE` rules
set up which change the source IP of the packets, making them not match the negotiated
IPsec policies when IPsec processing of outgoing packets happens in the
{NETFILTER}[Netfilter packet flow] `*xfrm lookup*` node. To fix this problem, packets
with a matching IPsec policy should skip NAT rules in the `POSTROUTING` chain of
the `*nat*` table. This is achieved by inserting a rule that accepts packets with
a matching IPsec policy before any NAT rule in the `POSTROUTING` chain
----
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -m policy --pol ipsec --dir out -j ACCEPT
----

== Split-Tunneling

With split-tunneling the clients will only send traffic for specific destination
subnets to the gateway. For both protocol versions split-tunneling is easy to deploy
f traffic selectors (TS) can freely be configured on both peers. In that case you'd
simply use specific values for the `*local_ts*` and `*remote_ts*` options.

=== Split-Tunneling with IKEv2

With IKEv2, *split-tunneling* is quite easy to use as the protocol inherently
supports the narrowing of the proposed traffic selectors.

For instance, if the client proposes `*0.0.0.0/0*` as a remote traffic selector, i.e.
(`*remote_ts = 0.0.0.0/0*`), this proposal can be narrowed on the gateway by
configuring `*local_ts =* <list of subnets>`. Likewise, the client may already propose
a selective remote TS by configuring a list of subnets with `*remote_ts*` which the
gateway might simply accept (e.g. if it has configured `*local_ts = 0.0.0.0/0*`)
or could further narrow the subnets to be tunneled.

While the protocol supports split-tunneling, whether it can actually be used
*depends on the client*. Most remote access clients will propose `*0.0.0.0/0*` as
remote TS, so split-tunneling must be configured explicitly on the gateway. But
whether this will actually result in split-tunneling will depend on the client.
All strongSwan based clients (Linux, NetworkManager, Android) support this kind
of narrowing whereas for Windows clients the situation is as follows:

Windows 7 ::
  The client will always allow access to the host's LAN. So to access e.g. a local
  printer nothing special has to be done. Since the client always proposes `*0.0.0.0/0*`
  as remote TS, the gateway is free to narrow it to a subset. But to make split-tunneling
  actually work on the client, the _Use default gateway on remote network_ option
  in the _Advanced TCP/IP_ settings of the VPN connection has to be disabled. Also,
  because a classful route is installed, the virtual IP address has to belong to the
  remote subnet, otherwise the _Disable class based route addition_ option has to
  be enabled and routes have to be installed manually.

Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 ::
  Microsoft introduced {VPNCLIENT}[PowerShell cmdlets] to configure VPN connections.
  These provide more options and also allow to configure split tunneling directly
  (`*-SplitTunneling*` option).

Windows 10 ::
  Split tunneling is enabled by default but with the same limitations seen since
  Windows 7, i.e. the virtual IP has to be from the remote subnet or routes have
  to be added manually, e.g. via the
  {VPNCLIENT}/Add-VpnConnectionRoute?view=win10-ps[Add-VpnConnectionRoute] PowerShell
  command. To tunnel all traffic via VPN instead, split tunneling has to be disabled
  explicitly, either by enabling the _Use default gateway on remote network_
  setting described above or by using the following PowerShell command
+
----
Set-VpnConnection "<Connection Name>" -SplitTunneling 0
----

=== Split-Tunneling with IKEv1

IKEv1 does not provide narrowing of traffic selectors by default.  That means that
the traffic selector configuration usually has to *match exactly* on both peers.
To simplify things, the IKEv1 implementation in the
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon does support *narrowing* of traffic
selectors similar to how it is implemented for IKEv2. Unfortunately, this is not
compatible with many third party implementations.

On the other hand, such clients may support the *Unity extensions* developed by
Cisco. The xref:plugins/unity.adoc[`*unity*`] plugin provides strongSwan gateways
with a transparent way of assigning narrowed traffic selectors to clients that
support these extensions (e.g., `*racoon*` as used in Apple products). The
xref:plugins/attr.adoc[`*attr*`] and xref:plugins/attr-sql.adoc[`*attr-sql*`] plugins
provides the means to manually configure attributes that enable split-tunneling
for Unity-aware clients.

== MTU/MSS Issues

It is possible that you encounter MSS/MTU problems when tunneling traffic. This is
caused by broken routers dropping ICMP packets and thus breaking PMTUD (Path MTU
Discovery). You can work around these issues by lowering the advertised MSS value
of TCP with the `TCPMSS` target in `*iptables*`.

Or if you control the router in question, fixing PMTU may be advisable. To do so
you need to permit the appropriate ICMP traffic (type 3, destination unreachable,
code 4, fragmentation needed - though all of type 3 is usually allowed).
In particular one must pay attention to the source address of ICMP messages emitted
by the VPN gateway, which will usually be the primary IP address of the gateway's
internal interface, *not* that of the endpoint experiencing the issue.

The value you set with the `TCPMSS` target must accommodate for any other overhead
introduced by the tunneling protocols in use (e.g., UDP encapsulation of ESP).
Google the issue and read the man page of `*iptables*` and `*iptables-extensions*`
if there are any questions about its usage.

The `*charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.mss*` and `*charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.mtu*`
options may be used, too, but the values set there apply to the routes that
the `*kernel-netlink*` plugin installs and the impact of them onto the traffic and
the behavior of the kernel is currently quite unclear.

Add the following `*iptables*` rules on the IKE responder to reduce the MSS (as
noted above, the actual values depend on the overhead imposed by the tunneling
protocols and the MTU, so it might have to be lower than what is used in the
example here):
----
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -m policy --pol ipsec --dir in  -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -m policy --pol ipsec --dir out -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360
----
Alternatively, you can add the same rules in `PREROUTING` and `POSTROUTING`
(also in the `*mangle*` table). Additionally set `*net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc=1*`
on the server.

In newer kernels the counter `*XfrmOutStateModeError*` in `*/proc/self/net/xfrm_stat*`
is incremented if the kernel detects that a packet would be too large after
encapsulation.
