Before you request help or ask questions, please give the following items some
consideration to avoid wasting your and our time and for optimizing the time it
takes to find a solution.

* If you are *new to strongSwan* please read the
  xref:howtos/introduction.adoc[introduction].

* If you look for *help regarding configuration*, base your configuration on the
  xref:config/quickstart.adoc[quickstart examples] first to avoid generic problems.

* If you have problems with *traffic not reaching hosts via VPN*, read the
  documentation regarding xref:howtos/forwarding.adoc[forwarding traffic,
  split-tunneling and MTU/MSS issues].

* If you are **reporting a security issue**, refer to the dedicated
  xref:support/flawReporting.adoc[security flaw reporting instructions].

* If you require help with *configuring special strongSwan features*, browse
  the *Configuration*, *Features* and *Howtos* sections in the
  {DOCS}[documentation] first.

== Finding Problem Solutions Effectively and Efficiently

For other problems please follow these steps:

. Read the xref:support/faq.adoc[Frequently Asked Questions] (FAQ).

. Read the manuals (i.e. the man pages that come with *your* strongSwan version). +
  Make sure your version of the man pages correspond to strongSwan and not FreeS/WAN,
  Openswan or Libreswan. The software that a man page belongs to is usually printed
  in the center top of the man page when it's initially opened.

. Make sure you put the files into the right directories. On distributions that stem
  from RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), strongSwan configuration files are stored
  under `*/etc/strongswan*`.

. If the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[*`charon*`] daemon crashes,
  xref:support/faq.adoc#_strongswan_crashes[try these things first].

. Make sure your strongSwan version is up to date. A lot of actual bugs (not user
  errors) are fixed in the latest strongSwan versions.

. Search issues and {DISCUSS}[discussion threads] using {GITHUB}[GitHub's
  search function] for keywords from the logs or keywords that describe your
  problem. +
  Perhaps also search the old bug tracker via its {SEARCH}[search function]
  or the old {LISTS}[mailing list archives] (e.g. via `*site:lists.strongswan.org*`
  in a search engine). +
  However, it's usually easiest to use your favorite search engine directly as
  you might also find answers on Stack Exchange etc.

. Now, you may ask for help. Please write your posts in English only. Do not
  write your posts in any other language. Please include or attach your
  complete config files (xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`],
  xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`], etc.) and a complete log file
  showing the problem. Please supply text files. Pictures are not useful.
  If you are told to provide the data in the IRC channel of strongSwan, then
  please use a pastebin of your choice and provide links to your pastes. Use
  different pastes for different data.

We generally require *all* of the following from you:

* The *complete log* from daemon start to the point where the problem occurs

* The *complete configuration*  (xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]
  or `*ipsec.conf*`, depending on the configuration interface you are using)

* The *complete current status* of the daemon (
  xref:swanctl/swanctlListConns.adoc[`*swanctl --list-conns*`] and
  xref:swanctl/swanctlListSas.adoc[`*swanctl --list-sas*`] or `*ipsec statusall*`)

* The *complete firewall rules* (output of `*iptables-save*` and `*ip6tables-save*`
  on Linux, analogously on other operating systems using the corresponding commands)

* The *complete contents of all routing tables* (output of `*ip route show table all*`
  on Linux, analogously on other operating systems)

* The *complete overview over all IP addresses* (output of `*ip addr*` on Linux,
  analogously on other operating systems)

When you create a log file, use the xref:config/logging.adoc[log settings] from
xref:#_configuration_snippets[the bottom of the page] unless we tell you otherwise.
If you (or your distribution) use a Linux Security Module (LSM), like AppArmor,
Selinux, YAMA or TOMOYO, you need to allow the IKE daemon (
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`],
xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`], etc.) to create and write
to that logfile first, or disable the LSM for the time of the debugging. Obviously
allowing the daemon to create and write the file is preferred.

== Dealing with Linux Security Modules (LSM)

In order for strongSwan to be able to write the logfile, it has to be allowed by
the OS. If the OS implements an LSM, like CentOS with Selinux or Ubuntu like
AppArmor, it is likely that the LSM prevents strongSwan from writing the logfile.
If that is the case, there will be a log record for that in the audit log (ususally
under `*/var/log/audit/audit.log*` or `*/var/log/audit.log*`). Setting the LSM into
permissive mode for strongSwan while logging is required is one of the acceptable
ways of allowing it to do that. The following subsections show the commands to do
that.

All advice in this section applies only temporarily. After a reboot, the previous
configured status applies again. For example, if AppArmor was active in enforce
mode before you put it in permissive mode, it will likely be in enforce mode again
after the reboot.

=== AppArmor

The information about AppArmor was taken from {APPARMOR}[this article]. All
commands have to be executed with root privileges.

==== Check if AppArmor is active

Run at least one of the following commands to determine if AppArmor is active

 aa-status or aa-enabled

==== Set complain mode for strongSwan temporarily

 sudo aa-complain <path to charon/charon-systemd binary>

e.g `*sudo aa-complain /usr/libexec/ipsec/charon*`.

You can find out what the path is by either checking `*ps aux*` or if strongSwan
isn't running, by examining the contents of the packages that provide strongSwan
on the system.

==== Disable AppArmor mode globally temporarily

 sudo aa-teardown

Unknown if this works on anything but Arch Linux.

=== Selinux

The information about Selinux was taken from {SELINUX}[this article].

==== Check if Selinux is active

 sestatus

==== Set permissive mode for strongSwan temporarily

 sudo semanage permissive -a <domain of the strongSwan process>

e.g. `sudo semanage permissive -a strongswan_t*`.

You can find out what the domain is by either checking `*ps auxZ*` or if strongSwan
isn't running, by examining the contents of the packages that provide strongSwan
on the system.

==== Set permissive mode globally temporarily

 sudo echo 0 > /sys/fs/selinux/enforce

==== Set enforce mode globally temporarily

 sudo echo 1 > /sys/fs/selinux/enforce

== Configuration Snippets

IMPORTANT: On Windows, use a different path from */var/log/...* or */tmp/*.
           Use e.g. just *charon.log* which creates the file in the working
           directory of the process (if it is allowed to do so).

Use the following snippet in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
for version < 5.7.0
----
  filelog {
    /var/log/charon_debug.log {
      time_format = %a, %Y-%m-%d, %H:%M:%S
      default = 2
      net = 1
      enc = 1
      asn = 1
      job = 1
      ike_name = yes
      append = no
      flush_line = yes
    }
  }
----

Use the following snippet in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
for version >= 5.7.0
----
  filelog {
    # any arbitrary name without dots for the section instead of the one given here
    charon-debug-log {
      # this setting is required with 5.7.0 and newer if the path contains dots
      path = /var/log/charon_debug.log
      time_format = %a, %Y-%m-%d, %H:%M:%S
      default = 2
      net = 1
      enc = 1
      asn = 1
      job = 1
      ike_name = yes
      append = no
      flush_line = yes
    }
  }
